		<p><br>You're mail has been sent successfully and it might have already made its way to my Inbox but I've a poor internet connection. And it may also take a while for me to read and respond to your mail, as I have a huge number of fan mails coming in, like 2 or 3 a month (of which 2 are mostly spam). Don't worry, till then get yourself a drink.</p><p><a href="#" class="button small">Close</a><br></div>
