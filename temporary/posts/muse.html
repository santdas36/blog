Random Thoughts
Tinkering Wild<br>
Scrambled Mind
Hard To Bind<br>
Memories Flash
Tenses Clash<br>
Fathomless Words
Inked With Swords<br>
At Stars They Roar
But None Adore<br>
Chills Surround
Yet Musing Around</h3>
</p>
<p>Yo, man! Why the hell did you turn off the torch? You're comfortably taking a nap behind those matte mountains. But think about me. It's the lustrous beam of yours that kept me defrosted, while the darkness haunted the exoteric world. And when that shedded, extrinsic thoughts melted in the intrinsic mind, though my body was already under the dark's supremacy; without your red, the bones fell numb. Those driftless thoughts raced down and flowed up the Milky Way, took a diversion at the nth dimension and returned back to nowhere! Hit-or-Miss, they were on a building trade, selling random slates.</p> <p>Types of tinkerers exist, but none where of my kind, that thingy thinks and does clumpsy things, that in quest of an advent, scrambles the perfect pieces, throws them at far corners, collects them again after a grievous hunt, and tries to bind those mismatching pieces, but forgets the sequence. </p><p>Finally, connections were made and a few adverse, that mined a hole in the memory's whole. They flashed, flashed like for just seconds, adding a little sweet to the bitter cold, but swayed across in a moment. Not the past, but I sighted at the never happening so-called Future, why to leave their participles. </p><p>That was such a pleasure to witness them clash, though the Present stood still, with its swords raised high. 'If the present's swords could yeild such strength, why couldn't a pen, bring back the heat?' asked my tailored mind. I chose. Yeah, I chose but not the pen. I made my sword itself my pen and all that it inked were the transcriptions of the scriptures on stone that laid hidden deep inside me. So unfathomable to others, but their voices never stopped echoing, resonating the dischord beats inside. </p><p>Their voice didn't cease to exsist beside me, but reached each and every star that lies scattered at no man's reach, and roared at them. Yes, they can give you the exact count of stars, so meager. But the stars never let any to reflect back to me with a little of their heat. How cruel! Do they lack the knack to adore at the voices of mine? or Do they envy at them and wanted to have for themselves? No idea, but one thing I realized was 'The more I tried to get back the heat, the more I found myself frozen.'</p><p>That wasn't all. I borrowed a telescope, doesn't matter from whom, and peeped into the darkness. I saw those stars, and my voices, so obstruse yet rumbling at them. And they didn't die there as I thought, rather they all started to deflect yet managed to unite as one beam of eternal energy. Then it took me a while to realize that the batteries of your torch have dried up and those rays of eternity flooded a rain on them. How soothing! I thought it were you keeping me warm with your light, but it was I, feeding you with the voices of my heart. I will not ask you to pay bills but I shall keep writing and you, get on your batteries juiced and turn on the flash. I'm freezing to death, yet musing around to stay put.</p></div>
