Curtains worried the wind and the ow,<br>
Turbid trees never remembered to grow<br>
In the midst of which smokes out thou.<br>
Is it but your eerie shriek, they revere<br>
Or the wrath of your wraith, they fear?<br>
Whatever, I wish not to dig you up, dear<br>
And you too shall not drench me in tear.<br>
So don't you get to me, or to me mere!</h3>

<p>No novel was that day. The Sun went into hiding as always, and I was gearing up to hunt down my thoughts. But only till then. Such things were to happen on a diurnal cycle, especially during the days of extremity in coldness under the enigma of moon! But that day pitched on top of the crests of waves, which I suppose must have forgotten to accompanied the troughs. I could have opted to go in with my brother to his, but I thought nothing worse than him shall peep into my room and choke me to death.</p>

<p>So, yes, with a sense of snoopiness and a lot of courage, I curbed myself to one of the four corners, didn't know which, but the one that stayed right across the window, so that I can clearly espy on whatsoever was upon me, eagerly awaiting to reach me and make sure I stay at the farthest possible away from it! Wish they had legs - poor trees! I can even count their leaves, it was winter, dude! My old grannie's measuring tapes are bootless. My eyes have never seen them grow since June of 2001. I wasn't born before. Yeah. Good old memories flash up, let me save them for the next article XD.</p>

<p>And suddenly, somewhere between those trees in my backyard, arose a brouhaha of babbling tenor. My ears bugged out, I felt that in my veins, coursing through and then the push. It started to smoke out in the coldest of winter nights, soothing but striking! Might the curtains have been a layer of pellucid disturbance, they flew into the woods. Now, none between me and... Whaaattt!! I saw her, she... she was wearing a long white robe. A glimpse of disillusion and dismay, the adrenaline rush. Can I see you again? Before I could ask, the smoke and the warmth retraced back.</p>

<p>Morning. I'm done with that gorge' dream, I swear. With that being said, I'm awake. The snow was real and the heaters didn't work.</p>

<p>"Momma, where's ma jacket?"</p>

<p>"Why can't you take care of your things yourself, you useless?" (ignore :p)</p>

<p>"Check your closet!" she shouted from the downstairs.</p>

<p>My legs trembled (of cold), but still I managed to reach the closet, a few steps from my bed. I tried, but it won't open! I anointed the rusty orange door-hinge, with lubricants but in vain. No other way, I had to share my Touche's stinky sweater. I went out to the backyard, and they haven't grown a bit, they wished me good with their white blossoms. Later then, I went through my usual chores, the same tiring things I've been doing since the advent of the winter birds. Write, sleep, dream, repeat. </p>
