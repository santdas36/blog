<blockquote>
<br>
It's ok that the thing isn't over.<br>
It's ok that you had a fall.<br>
It's ok that you're frightened<br>
and that you'll get through'em all.<br>
It's ok that you climb too hard,<br>
to find yourself in some pitfall.<br>
And that, you now know it isn't over,<br>
It's nothing-less-than-okay to try, y'all.<br>
It's ok that you think you were never born,<br>
or you wish everyone else be dead and gone.<br>
It's ok that the clock is ticking<br>
and you're running out of choice.<br>
Somewhere between chaos and doritos,<br>
you'll find your voice or you'll be played their toys.<br>
It's ok that its 3 in the morning and freezing cold outside<br>
and you're still awake, trying to comfort yourself<br>
with the warmth of lies that were spun by your wise.<br>
And that there awaits after dark, an alluring sunrise,<br>
It's ok that it's three and you're still awake.<br>
It's ok that you're unable to pick out<br>
what is reality and that the fantasy<br>
unless and until you enjoy your pies.<br>
It's ok that the things have changed<br>
and now that ctrl+z won't work,<br>
you'll have to learn to lurk.<br>
Its ok that numbers didn't play your game,<br>
rather they have lead you to mirk.<br>
It's ok that you had to leave them alone or them, alone<br>
or if you were to be that left out one, trust me hon!<br>
It's ok because you exist among those whose zones<br>
aren't the same as those before, once it's dawn.<br>
It's ok to be cautious while walking over thin ice.<br>
It's ok if the ice broke,<br>
and it's even ok 'cause you woke.<br>
It's ok if you forget to sleep and equally ok<br>
if you don't remember to wake.<br>
Sometimes, it's okay to be.<br>
Just be.<br>
<br>
It's okay.<br>
Because, you never wanted to ask.</blockquote></div>
